## Project Overview

With cryptocurrency taking storm across social media outlets and the media I decided to take on the feat of creating a Blockchain. If you are unfamiliar with a Blockchain, it is essentially type of immutable database that is not prone to any sort of tampering. 
I created this Blockchain using Python, Flask, and Postman. I felt that this project expose me to the ins and outs of Python, as well as a small introduction to a different web framework.
