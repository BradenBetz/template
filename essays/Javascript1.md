Javascript will be the the fourth programming language that I will be learning.  Already knowing Java, C, and C++ gave some comfort coming into Javascript.  I initially thought of the language as a more web based, HTML looking coding language but I was quickly proven wrong withe the first assignments I was given on the lanaguage.  The syntax across Java, C and C++, are extremely similar to Javascript, and I feel that Javascript is even easier.  Variable assignment and declaration standards are more lax than I previously thought.  Having the ability to use variable that can store anything makes the project creation process much more smooth and less tedious.

Now, is Javascript a good or bad lanagauge within the realm of Software Engineering?  I believe that is a good language for experienced programmers, who aren't prone to the typical errors that a new programmer would run into, such as debugging or the initial planning process.  With languages like C or Java, you are required to use explicit type declarations, like 'int' or 'string' to explicity declare a variables type.  This would help with the planning process, and figuring out how different types will fit into the differnet projects requirments.  Since Javascript doesn't require a programmer to explicitly declare a variables type, I feel that a newer programmers would get confused and become overwhelemed.  I do feel that programmers that are new to Javascript but not programming, like me, could run into the same problem.  But with the prior experience I feel that it would be less overwhemling, but only time will tell.

Along with Javascript, I was also introduced to the WOD pedagogy, otherwise know as athletic software engineering.  It builds on the idea that if you "workout" by practicing writing a simple program within a set amount of time, you will get better over time.  As an avid weightlifter for the past year and a half, I understand that this idea works, and everyone can improve a programming language, just like weightlifting, so long as they put in the max amount of effort possible.  Getting better at something and getting the results desired requires constant practice and failure, which our Professor touched upon, as he designed the WOD pedagogy for all students to fail eventually.  I do think that they will work for me very well, as I understand what it takes to see results and improvement, and that it isn't easy at all.  I do find the practice WODs that are given to me helpful, and I enjoy the challenege.  Before the first WOD I did get a bit stressed, but realized that would lead to my demise, and told myself to fall back and let my programming experience do the work for me.
