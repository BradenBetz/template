## The patterns of Programming

When I was first introduced to programming during my Fall 2017 semester at UH Manoa, I was astounded at how problem-solving was prevalent within each project and assignment that we did.  I had to take a step back each time and analyze each problem to figure out the parts that I needed to solve the problem.  From there on out, whenever I got stuck, I would think of the previous problems I've had before and see what I could use from previous code files to solve my current problem.  Coming into ICS 314 for my Spring 2019 semester I was finally introduced to what is known as design patterns.  Based on the research I have done online, I have come to realize that I've been using them for the entire length of time I have been programming. Although I have not been using them on a level that is as high as Software Engineering, I definitely used aspects of it when solving different coding problems. 

## Using the pieces made by other programmers

One instance I used Design Patterns was in ICS 211 when I was first introduced to Object Oriented Programming.  I used the method of a singleton class.  In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a comparator that compared the ABV and IBU of different types of beers.  Using the singleton design pattern, it would make sure that only one instance of *Manoa Brewing* was present, which is the 'Brewery' that made the beers for the particular project.  I've read that the Singleton Design pattern has a lot of pros and cons, and is one of the most discussed design patterns among programmers today.  Another possible Design Pattern I have possibly used would be the implementation of a linked list.  The principle of implementing a linked list is the same throughout programming in my opinion, but specifying it to your needs is up to the programmer.  In ICS 212 I was tasked with implementing a linked list that held different records for a mock bank database.  I had to research exactly how a linked list worked to be able to specify how the linked list was supposed to work for my assignment.
