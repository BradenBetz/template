Ethics within the realm of Computer Science has always been something that has sat at the back of my head, as I always wonder how the programs and software I write and create will play a part within the world that they are deployed into.  I've never had to worry about that thus far, as the projects and programs I have worked on have never been given out for public use, and stayed within the comfort of UH Manoa.  Ethics for me, within the world of Computer Science, is making sure that the programs that are created are used in a manner that benefit the well being of society as a whole, and making sure the program is not used maliciously.
