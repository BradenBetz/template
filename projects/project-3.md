summary: Eagle Project for the Boy Scouts Of America
---

One project that is not related to Computer Science was my eagle project that was done to obtain the rank of Eagle Scout.  My project consisted of the repainting and cleaning of several hatches that served as different access points on the U.S.S Missouri, as well as a berthing room.  All of these points were areas on the ship that were frequented by visitors to the memorial.

Since this project was the final step to obtain the rank of eagle scout, I led 25-30 inidivudals, explained their jobs and duties, as well as how to conduct themselves on a national memorial.  I was in charge of planning the project, discussing the places that needed to be painted and cleaned with one of the managers at the Missouri.  It took around 6 months of planning to set a date and obtain the materials needed to execute the project.

I can say that I learned a lot from this experience.  I learned how to effectively manage and lead a large group of people, which did prove difficult at times when different individuals had different problems that I needed to address.  I also learned how to effectively plan and execute a goal that had tremendous purpose and backstory, which was to get the berthing room and several hatches on the ship cleaned and repainted.  Overall, I feel that this experience prepared me for the team aspect of computer science, and in ways helped me to become a better leader.
