## Experiencing Javascript for the first time

<img class="ui medium centered image" src="bradenbetz.github.io/Anyone_notice_the_javascript.png">

Javascript will be the fourth programming language that I will be learning.  Already knowing Java, C, and C++ gave some comfort coming into Javascript.  I initially thought of the language as a more web-based, HTML looking code, but I was quickly proven wrong with the couple first assignments I was given on the language.  The syntax across Java, C, and C++ are extremely similar to Javascript, and I feel that Javascript language is even easier.  Variable assignment and declaration standards are laxer than I previously assumed.  For example, having the ability to use a variable that can store anything makes the project creation process much more smooth and less tedious in my opinion.

## Is Javascript a good or bad programming language?

Now, is Javascript a good or bad language within the realm of Software Engineering?  I believe that is a good language for experienced programmers, who aren't prone to the typical caveat that a new programmer would run into, such as debugging or the initial planning process. Languages like C or Java, require the programmer to use explicit type declarations, like 'int' or 'string' to declare the type of variable.  This could help tremendously with the planning process, and figuring out how different types will fit into the requirements of the different projects.  Since Javascript doesn't require a programmer to explicitly declare the type of a variable, I feel that newer programmers would get confused and become overwhelmed.  I do feel that programmers that are new to Javascript but not programming, like me, could run into the same problem.  But with the prior experience, I feel that it would be less overwhelming, but only time will tell.  All in all, the ease of use with Javascript could be extremely beneficial to larger groups of programmers who need to work on projects at a faster pace.

## Working out with Javascript

Along with Javascript, I was also introduced to the Athletic Software Engineering pedagogy, which contained WODs, or 'Workout of the day'.  It is based on the idea that if you "workout" by writing a simple program within a set amount of time, you will get better over time.  As an avid weightlifter and gym goer for the past year and a half, I understand that idea of practicing every day and keeping consistency can provide results, and with that, everyone can improve a programming language, just like weightlifting, so long as they put in the max amount of effort possible.  Getting better at something and getting the results desired requires constant practice and failure, which our Professor touched upon, as he designed the WOD pedagogy for all students to fail eventually.  Failure, in my opinion, is something that I welcome, as growth only comes through failure.  I do think that WODs will work very well for me, as I understand what it takes to see results and improvement, and that nothing worth having is easily obtainable.  I do find the practice WODs that are given to me helpful and stressful, and I welcome the challenge.  Before the first WOD, I did get a bit stressed, but realized that would lead to my demise, and told myself to fall back and let my programming experience do the work for me.  Using that mindset ended up working out, and it's what I plan to do for future WODs, and assignments.
