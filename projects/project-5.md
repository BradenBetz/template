summary: The final project for my ICS 414 class was to create an Greenhouse Gas tracker for Hawaiian Electric.
---
## Project Overview

For the second year Software Engineering class, our class was broken up into four teams and tasked with creating a Greenhouse Gas calculator for the local poweer company Hawaiian Electric.

## Project Contribution

For this project I was tasked with creating the login page, password reset page, as well as a bar graph on the Profile page. The bar graph was linked to the mongo database, which tallies the total amount of times a user took a certain method of travel  (Car, Bike, Telework, etc.).
